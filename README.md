# glycoproteinQC
Finding steady-state solutions for a model of the glycoprotein quality control pathway.

This Matlab code accompanies the manuscript by Brown and Koslover:
"Design principles for the glycoprotein quality control pathway"

To calculate the steady-state solutions for the pathway model, look inside
